This thesis presents the general principles of designing and synchronizing peer-to-peer (P2P) multiplayer on-line games over Named Data Networking (NDN), a brand new Internet architecture that aims at improving networking efficiency by naming content instead of hosts. We introduced NDN namespace design for games, and proposed a fine-grained synchronization mechanism by dividing game synchronization into asset, state and event synchronization. Our proposal is implemented as the network component of \emph{EgalCar}, a multiplayer car racing game. With the combination of NDN and our fine-grained synchronization mechanism, we envision an overall improvement in P2P games' consistency, interactivity and scalability.
